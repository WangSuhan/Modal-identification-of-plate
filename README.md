Modal analysis
------
Modal analysis is a modern method to study the dynamic characteristics of structures. It is an application of system identification method in engineering vibration field. Mode is the natural vibration characteristic of mechanical structure, and each mode has a specific natural frequency, damping ratio and mode shape. These modal parameters can be obtained by computational or experimental analysis, a process called modal analysis. This analysis process is obtained by the finite element method.
