Modal analysis
------
Modal analysis is a modern method to study the dynamic characteristics of structures. It is an application of system identification method in engineering vibration field. Mode is the natural vibration characteristic of mechanical structure, and each mode has a specific natural frequency, damping ratio and mode shape. These modal parameters can be obtained by computational or experimental analysis, a process called modal analysis. This analysis process is obtained by the finite element method.
  
  * Single mode recognition-calculus of differences
  
  This is the effect of the single mode identification method, and the crest is the natural frequency.

  These are the first to fourth order modes of the plate

  * Multimodal recognition-Nonlinear weighted least square method
  This is the effect of the multi-mode identification method, and the crest is the natural frequency.
